Version 1
---------
The application "ColorMachine" has been created by Tobias Stamm. It is meant
to be a tool to convert color values from different color spaces. The tool
uses the implementation of MBLib as a backend. Many bugs in the implementation
of MBLib have been fixed during the development of ColorMachine and now is a
highly prooved color transformation implementation.

The application has been used by some people starting at the end of november
2009. The author decided then to call the implementation with the provided
functionality version 1.
